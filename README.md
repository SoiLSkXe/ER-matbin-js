# ER-matbin-js
A simple javascript library to convert matxml/matbin, a newly introduced material definition format since Elden Ring AFAIK, to/from json for facilitating modification.
Written for personal use and in-game verification is currently very limited. Simply use it as a reference for the file format.

## Usage
Install the latest Node.js or Deno and drag & drop json or matbin files into the .bat file in the corresponding _exec folder.
Or access [an online version](https://soilskxe.github.io/ER-matbin-js/html/matbinEditor.html) through your browser.
